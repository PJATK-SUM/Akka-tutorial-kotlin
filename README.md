# Akka tutorial kotlin

## What is this?

This is my kotlin interpretation of [java Akka tutorial](https://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/2.5.13/) code.

## Why?

I wanted to get started on Akka and occasionally to do it with kotlin.

## What the difference from original?

All examples are written in kotlin and structurally similar to official ones (to some degree).
Yet there was a need to adjust style towards functional programming. 
Also there are some parts that I considered to make my way (in most cases trying to increase readability,
for example I moved all protocol related classes to specific files).

## Translated examples map

- *hello-world-sample* - [Akka Quickstart with Java](https://developer.lightbend.com/guides/akka-quickstart-java/) from [Getting Started Guid Introduction](https://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/2.5.13/guide/index.html)
- *iot-sample* - [Getting Started Guid Part 1-5](https://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/2.5.13/guide/index.html)
- *cluster-sample* - [A Simple Cluster Example](https://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/2.5.14/cluster-usage.html#a-simple-cluster-example)

## Additionally

I am no expert on kotlin and still trying to master it along with functional programming paradigms,
so there almost definitely will be some quirks and misuse of concepts. 
If you know a way to do something better I will be more then happy to fix it.
