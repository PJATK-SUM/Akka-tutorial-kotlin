# Akka tutorial kotlin

## What is this?

This is my kotlin interpretation of [java Akka tutorial](https://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/2.5.13/) code.

## Why?

I wanted to get started on Akka and occasionally to do it with kotlin.

## What the difference from original?

All examples are written in kotlin and structurally similar to some degree official ones.
Yet there was a need to adjust style towards functional programming. 
Also there are some bits that considered to make my way (in most cases trying to increase readability).
For example I moved all protocol related classes to specific files.

## Translated examples map

- *hello-world-sample* - [Akka Quickstart with Java](https://developer.lightbend.com/guides/akka-quickstart-java/) from [Getting Started Guid Introduction](https://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/2.5.13/guide/index.html)
- *iot-sample* - [Getting Started Guid Part 1-5](https://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/2.5.13/guide/index.html)

## Additionally

I am no super expert on kotlin and still trying to master it along with functional programming paradigm,
so there almost definitely will be some quirks and misuse of concepts. 
If you find such or find a way to do something better I will be more then happy to fix it.
